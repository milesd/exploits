/*  This little program opens as many sockets with a remote
 *  host as can be supported by both.  It catches ^C and kill
 *  commands to shut down cleanly by closing all open connections
 *  before exiting.  Often, a remote workstation can be brought
 *  to its knees by saturating its process table via multiple
 *  invocations of sendmail.  That's why port 25 (the sendmail
 *  port) is the default.  If the target's process table (set
 *  when the target kernel was created) is filled, users will be
 *  unable to execute any shell commands.  Many MUDs also crash
 *  when the number of sockets they have open exceeds a certain
 *  number.  This program will put stress on MUDs by testing
 *  their limits.  If a limit is reached, the MUD will either
 *  crash or will refuse to let new users log in.
 *
 *  The program is incomplete, in that it doesn't check for
 *  socket timeouts and subsequently reuse timed out sockets.
 *  That means the program can only keep a remote host / mud
 *  locked up until it exhausts its own available new sockets,
 *  or until it has reached MAX_DESCRIPTORS remote connections
 *  as set by the #define statement.
 *
 *  If the local machine starts issuing error messages, then
 *  the program has failed to saturate the remote host and has
 *  instead reached the limits of the local machine.  Use ^C or
 *  the kill command to terminate it.  If you are knowledgable
 *  about rebuilding kernels and have access to the root account,
 *  you can build a special kernel that will allow you to reach
 *  a much larger number of open sockets.
 *
 *  Before running this, be sure to issue the c shell command:
 *              'limit descriptors nnn'
 *  where nnn is the largest descriptor limit, as revealed
 *  by the 'limit -h' command if applicable.  Some unixes may
 *  not have a descriptors category at all.
 *
 *  This program has been tested with SunOS version 4.1.3, Irix
 *  version 5, and with Linux.
 *
 *  You don't need to be a privileged user to run it.
